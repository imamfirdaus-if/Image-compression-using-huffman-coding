The Huffman Coding Algorithm is one of the algorithms that can be used to compress data so that the resulting data size is lower than the actual size. The example discussed this time is about the compression and return of data from a sentence.
Huffman Coding is an optimized prefix code that is usually used in lossless data compression. This algorithm uses a special method to select the representative of each symbol, which finally produces a prefix code. This algorithm is such a well-known method for creating prefix codes that "Huffman Code" is widely used as a synonym of "prefix code" even for scripts that are not generated from Huffman Coding calculations.
